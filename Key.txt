📁 New File Structure
1. general-style.css (Unified CSS)

All styles consolidated into one file
Organized by sections with clear comments
Eliminated all duplication
Reduced from ~400+ lines total to a single organized stylesheet
Uses CSS custom properties (variables) for easy theming

2. main.js (All Logic & Content)

Data-driven approach: All content stored in pageData object
Component builders: Reusable functions to build HTML sections
Page renderers: renderHomePage() and renderDiatwinPage()
Auto-detection: Automatically loads correct page based on URL
Single source of truth for all content

3. index.html (Minimal)

Just 13 lines!
Links to CSS and JS files
Content generated dynamically

4. DiaTwin.html (Minimal)

Just 13 lines!
Same structure as index.html
Content generated dynamically

✨ Key Benefits

Massive code reduction: From ~1000+ lines to ~800 lines total (with better organization)
Zero duplication: All shared styles and components in one place
Easy maintenance: Update content in pageData object, changes reflect everywhere
Consistent styling: Single CSS file ensures visual consistency
Scalable: Easy to add new pages or sections

🚀 How to Use

Save all 4 files in your project root
Make sure file names match exactly:

general-style.css
main.js
index.html
DiaTwin.html


That's it! The JavaScript will automatically detect which page is loaded and render the appropriate content.

🎯 To Add New Content
Just edit the pageData object in main.js. For example, to add a new project:
javascript// In pageData.home.projects array
{
    badge: 'New Badge',
    title: 'New Project',
    subtitle: 'Project Subtitle',
    // ... rest of project data
}
The component builders handle all the HTML generation automatically!
